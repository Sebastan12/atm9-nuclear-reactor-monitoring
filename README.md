# Why does this exist?

On our ATM9 server we have a nuclear reactor that is loaded 24/7 - Our entire Applied Energetics 2 Storage hinges on this reactor working

This is why we made this simple API -> to keep track of the amount of uranium ingot in our system & alert us if the stock level goes to low

# What does this do?

Accepts POST Requests containing the current uranium ingot amount and provides prometheus metrics endpoioints so we can display it in grafana later

# How do I Set this up?

TO BE DONE

# How do I build the Image?
